**Mp3 Downloader**

**youtube.com (or music.youtube.com) to MP3**

**This script allows you to download YouTube videos or playlists as MP3 files and  embed album art/thumbnail into the MP3 files.**

It was also entirely written by ChatGPT. I don't know how to code. 


**Prerequisites**

Before using this script, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. Youâ€™ll also need a few Python libraries, which can be installed easily with pip.

Install the Required Libraries
Use the following command to install all the dependencies:

`` pip install yt-dlp mutagen pillow colorama  ``



**How to use:**
- go to cmd, then do `` cd [destination of .py file] ``
- enter `` python music.py ``
- Enter YouTube URL
- A new folder will be created called "downloads" and your mp3 will be in there
